1) Use the airfoil geometry to make the geometry for the 2d airfoil
	Vary the upper surface points from 0 to +10
	Vary the lower surface points from 0 to -10
2) Use the 2d airfoil to extrapolate into a 3d wing section
3) Use lifting-line theory to get 3d lift and drag approximations
4) Use the 3d wing to calculate the structural loading
5) Use the 3d wing profile to find the locations for the masses
